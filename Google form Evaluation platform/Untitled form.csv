It is a scalar quantity measured in kilograms (kg) or grams (g). Weight, on the other hand, is the force exerted by gravity on an object and varies depending on the gravitational field strength. It is a vector quantity measured in newton (N) or pounds (lb). While mass is an intrinsic property of an object, weight depends on the gravitational acceleration experienced by the object. Mass can be measured using a balance or scale, whereas weight is typically measured using a spring scale or weighing machine.","-- / 10",""
